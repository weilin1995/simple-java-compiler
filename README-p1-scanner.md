# Project 1 - Scanner

## Overview
For the scanner, we implemented `MiniJava.java` which currently accepts the -S flag to tokenize a program.
We edited `minijava.cup` and `minijava.jflex` to add all the symbols, terminals, etc.

## Test programs
We mainly tested on the Sample MiniJava programs already included under `SamplePrograms/SampleMiniJavaPrograms`.
We also added a few other java programs to test our scanner which are under `SamplePrograms/ScannerTestPrograms`.
