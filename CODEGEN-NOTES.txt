CODEGEN-NOTES

We implemented code generation mostly following the spec posted online.
We generate X86 assembly using the registers to pass arguments. 

The tricky parts involved debugging issues that came up as part of the project.

Most of the issues came from overriding registers with other data, and the fix,
usually involved pushing the old register data before overriding it.

We tested our code gen on various small test programs we made as well
as all of Sample Programs in MiniJavaPrograms. 

There is a small bash script (./allPrograms.sh) that we made to run all of the 
SampleMiniJavaPrograms, under normal java and our MiniJava compilier to make
sure there no differences.

In terms of changes made to past parts of the project, we fixed a few issues,
that were pointed out as part of the Semantic checker.
