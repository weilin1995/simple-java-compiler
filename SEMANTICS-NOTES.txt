SEMANTIC-NOTES
-------------------

We implemented all of the semantic checks outlined on the spec. 
We also added an additional check for the duplicate class name declarations, method name declarations, and variable declarations.

In terms of any changes to the previous parts, we made a few changes to our parser and scanner.
We fixed our grammar precedence and also updated our regex for a comment to fix an issue in Project 2.
