CSE 401/M501 Project III - Semantics

Typechecker sets exit status incorrectly (1 if any lexical/syntactic/semantic
errors or 0 if no errors at all). (-4)

Uniqueness of field names not checked; typechecker should report an error when a
class declares multiple fields with the same name (okay to shadow superclass's
declared fields). (-2)

Number of arguments to a method call is not checked. (-2)

Type of an if statement's condition is not checked. (-2)

False type error reported when a subclass declares a field with the same name
as a field in the superclass (shadowing is allowed). (-2)

False type error reported when the target of a method call is inherited by the
receiver's declared class type (e.g., '(new A()).m()' where class 'A' extends
class 'B', which defines method 'm'). (-2)

False type error reported when a method body returns a subtype of the declared
return type. (-2)

False type error reported when an overriding method declares its return type as
a subtype of the overridden method's declared return type. (-2)

Typechecker crashes with an unhandled NullPointerException when the source
program references an undefined class type. (-4)
