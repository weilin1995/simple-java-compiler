CSE 401/M501 Project II - Parser

Arithmetic operators should bind more tightly than Boolean operators. (-2)

Comparison operators (e.g., less than) should bind more tightly than Boolean operators (but less tightly than arithmetic operators). (-2)

Subscripts should bind more tightly than binary operators. (-2)

Method calls should bind more tightly than binary operators. (-1)

Field accesses should bind more tightly than binary operators. (-1)

Statements in a block were printed in reverse order. (-2)

Arguments of a method call were printed in reverse order. (-2)

Parameters of a method declaration were printed in reverse order. (-2)

The parser crashed on well-formed syntax, specifically when a comment separated "public" from "static void main". The error output suggests that the grammar could not shift the STATIC token. (-4)

Avoid superfluous output, like "Parsing completed." (-0)
