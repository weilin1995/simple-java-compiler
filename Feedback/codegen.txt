CSE 401 Project IV - Code Generation

Incorrect order-of-operations within an arithmetic expression; subexpressions
at the same precedence level (e.g., all operands to a multiplication) should be
evaluated left-to-right. (-2)

Boolean conjunction does not have proper short-circuit behavior; if 'e1'
in 'e1 && e2' reduces to 'false', then 'e2' should not even be evaluated. (-2)

Incorrect behavior of boolean conjunction; '0 < 1 && true && a < 5', where 'a'
was previously initialized to 0, should evaluate to 'true' (may help to know
that the expression was the condition in an 'if' statement). (-2)

Incorrect behavior of loop conditions; the condition expression in a 'while'
loop should be evaluated once per loop test, including any method calls with
side effects. (-4)

Shadowing fields are not kept distinct; if a class and its parent both have a
field 'int x', then the object layout will have two distinct fields, one for the
parent class's use and another for the child class's use. (-2)
